No matter what your background and skills are, you can contribute to this project. It would be a massive help if you [file an issue](https://github.com/schafer14/kubetube/issues/new) for improvement they would like to see or a topic you would like covered. 

I am also looking for people to help translate, design, write content, edit content, write documentation and suggest content. If you would like to get involved and are looking for a place to start: feel free to [contact me](https://keybase.io/bannerschafer).

In the future, I hope to write more documentation on how to contribute, set up a slack channel for open conversation, and populate more Github issues with tasks. If one of those seems particularly helpful to you, let me know and, I'll make it a priority.
