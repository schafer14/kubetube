# About

Welcome, I am so glad you are here. This site is about sharing my passion with you and providing a place where everyone can learn about programming, Go and Kubernetes. 

In the programming community, there has been a strong emphasis on ensuring that educational content is available to as many people as possible. This blog is an extension
of that goal. A wider varety of perspective helps the software development community build safer and better software more ethicaly. With that in mind, the
goal of this site is to provide content to those people who may have a harder time using other sites. Additionally, content on this site is published under permissive
licenses ensuring anyone wishes to extend, use, or redistribute the content for their purposes can do so legally.

What follows is a list of the core features of this project. If you feel that there are ways to make this content more accessible, I hope you [contribute](/contributing)
your ideas or skills.

## Language

Bringing content to as many languages as possible seems like an easy way to include a wider audience. While including every language is not currently feasable, a preliminary 
list of five languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese and Vietnamese) are the target for all content. Also, videos include subtitles for each of these languages. 

## Accessibility

A primary goal is to ensure content is easy to consume for people who have trouble interacting with a computer in the traditional sense. To do this, I include closed captions on videos,
as well as an emphasis on building a site that is easily consumable with a screen reader. 

## License

Content except where otherwise notice is published under the [MIT license](/license). You can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell
copies of this content or this site. I ask that if you do so to consider using a permissive license as well, but this is not a requirement.
